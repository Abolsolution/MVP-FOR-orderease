# Multi-Caf√© QR-Based Online Menu System

A Laravel-based web application that allows multiple caf√©s to manage and display their menus online. Each caf√© gets a unique QR code that customers can scan to view the menu without logging in. This system isolates each caf√©‚Äôs data, ensuring customers only see the menu for the scanned caf√©.
